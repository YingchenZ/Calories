## Calculate BMR and Daily Intake
1. <a href = https://www.diabetes.co.uk/bmr-calculator.html>BMR (Suggested Daily Calories)</a>
  * BMR for Men = 66.47 + (13.75 * weight [kg]) + (5.003 * size [cm]) − (6.755 * age [years])
  * BMR for Women = 655.1 + (9.563 * weight [kg]) + (1.85 * size [cm]) − (4.676 * age [years])
2. <a href = https://diabetesstrong.com/how-much-protein-carbs-fat-should-you-eat/>Daily Intake (40/40/20 Principle)</a>
  * Eg. Daily Suggested Calories = 2000 Cal
  * 2000 * 0.4 calories from protein / 4 = 200 g Protein
  * 2000 * 0.4 calories from carbs / 4 = 200 g carbs
  * 2000 * 0.2 calories from fat / 9 = 45 g fat
